# RPS-Albuquerque-Edition
A Breaking Bad Rock Paper Scissors game that uses a Google Teachable Machine AI model to capture your choice.

Using Javascript's p5.js library, we can bring a model trained in the GTM platform and use the class detection creatively.

[Have fun!](https://orlolvarez.github.io/RPS-Albuquerque-Edition/)
